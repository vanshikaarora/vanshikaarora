## Hi there :wave:
I am Vanshika, I am a high performing individual with excellent professional and technical skills achieved via remarkable Open Source Contributions, internship experience in companies and self-undertaken projects. I am pursuing Dual Degree (B.Tech+M.Tech) in Mathematics and Computing from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT ISM) Dhanbad](https://www.iitism.ac.in/)  with an outstanding academic record. 

My most recent experiences are two successive internships at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/) and being a [Google Summer of Code Student](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) at Wikimedia Commons. The project undertaken by me during all these experiences involves using various tech stacks and languages (like Android, Backend, Visual Studio, Java, C#) to develop a working solution for the current problem statement keeping and making a significant business impact from my contribution.
